**Parts List
- Hercules DJ Starlight
- rPi4
- Monitor control board (HDMI TYPE-C LCD Controller Board VS-RTD2556HC30-V1)
- Monitor 11.6in (N116HSE-EB1(or replacement model:N116HSE-EA1 REV.C1 N116HSE-EJ1 and so on)
- Keychron V1Z3
- Desired Panel Mount IO

**Gaps and things to be done
- there is no mount to the case bottom, I will need to 3d print peices to sit on the pellican cross mounts, or superglue mount points
- the Hurcules DJ wrap is not very accurate, I could use some help getting the edges to mount flush/perfect
- some of the control items are just for show atm (SNES inputs, toggle switches, USB IN is not supported on the current battery
- sometimes when booting into MIXX with the DJ Starlight, Vinyl control is disabled and the button does not toggle, restart required
- some cammand in MIXX are mouse only? need to reach out to MIXX ceators/mods and help build out a more complete keyboard only workflow
- right bottom panel mount is a bit wide, cosmetic issue, but need to roll back that panel to r1
- I need guidance on making this TSA worthy, buidling a project file database and wiring schematic and battery datasheet ect.
- 

**2D file review
- add images of lbrn2 layers and comments and recommended wood thicknesses
