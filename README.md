WMDJ - Weatherproof and Modular DJ 
Operation: unplanned obsolescence 

Welcome to the open source DJ cyberdeck project, sponsored by myself and hackerspace SUDOROOM in Oakland CA.

The project started as an art piece, in protest of the modern/popular practice of planned obsolescence

Project Codenames include:

**Project Description and Status:

The following project was built entirely at the hackerspace SUDOROOM in Oakland CA, all tools and processes are supported here to make your own unit

The current files provided are the top and bottom panels, in lightburn2 format for use on a lightburn supporting laser laithe

**Parts List
- Hercules DJ Starlight - really fun unit, if you know anyone at Hercules please get in contact! I really love the product)
- rPi4
- monitor control board (HDMI TYPE-C LCD Controller Board VS-RTD2556HC30-V1)
- monitor 11.6in (N116HSE-EB1(or replacement model:N116HSE-EA1 REV.C1 N116HSE-EJ1 and so on)
- Keychron V1Z3
- desired panel mount IO, telemetry, and accoutrement
- M3 and M6 allen bolts
- wood - 3mm 1.5mm for modular panels
- wood - 4/16in for top and bottom baseplates

**Gaps and things to be done
- panels are not mounted to the case interior, (may need to 3d print peices to sit on  pellican cross mounts, or superglue mount points)
- the Hurcules DJ wrap is not very accurate, I could use some help getting the edges to mount flush/perfect
- some of the control items are just for show atm (SNES inputs, toggle switches, USB IN is not supported on the current battery
- sometimes when booting into MIXX with the DJ Starlight, Vinyl control is disabled and the button does not toggle, restart required
- some cammand in MIXX are mouse only? need to reach out to MIXX ceators/mods and help build out a more complete keyboard only workflow
- right bottom panel mount is a bit wide, cosmetic issue, but need to roll back that panel to r1
- I need guidance on making this TSA worthy, buidling a project file database and wiring schematic and battery datasheet ect.
- I need guidance on a good mobile speaker with 0 latency and very durable, good TSA approved battery
- the goal was to finish the project in aluminium and paint with NATO black, but the wood gurilla look was popular in prototyping

**2D file review
- add images here of lbrn2 file layers 
- add comments and recommended wood thicknesses
