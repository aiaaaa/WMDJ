**Parts List
- Hercules DJ Starlight
- rPi4
- Monitor control board (HDMI TYPE-C LCD Controller Board VS-RTD2556HC30-V1)

**Gaps and things to be done
- there is no mount to the case bottom, I will need to 3d print peices to sit on the pellican cross mounts, or superglue mount points
- the Hurcules DJ wrap is not very accurate, I could use some help getting the edges to mount flush/perfect
- some of the control items are just for show atm (SNES inputs, toggle switches, USB IN is not supported on the current battery

**2D file review
- add images of lbrn2 layers and comments and recommended wood thicknesses
